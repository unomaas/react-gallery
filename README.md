# T2W10HW - Ryan's React Gallery App

Thanks for looking into my weekend project, the React gallery web app! 


# Description

Duration: 3 Day Sprint

This is a web based application that uses React to interact with a virtual server and database.  The objective was to get hands-on experience working with React to build a full-stack app using CRUD methodology.  

The app functionality will display tile images that, when clicked, would hide the image to show a text description.  There's also functionality for a Like button, a Like counter, and a Delete button.

I opted not to add a form to add new images, so that I can upload this app to a web server and send it to friends/family as a progress tracker (without them changing it up too much).

One note I'm really proud of: this app is dyslexia-friendly!  I added a custom font, "OpenDyslexia", to the server.  My mom suffers from dyslexia, and since she lives in a different state, I wanted to send this to her as a progress update without complications. <3


## Prerequisites

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/ 
PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/


## Built With

JavaScript/HTML/CSS, jQuery, React, Node, Bootstrap, Axios, PG. 


## Installation

To run this program, you will need to:
-- [] Build the database in your SQL server with the code in "database.sql" file. 
-- [] Run 'npm install' in your terminal to install the dependencies.
-- [] Run 'npm run server' in one terminal, and 'npm run client' in another terminal.


### Usage

#1. To use this app, start the server in your terminal.  Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.  

#2. It's auto-populated with images and descriptions from my life (thanks for looking!):
  a. Click an image to flip between displaying the image and the text description.
  b. Press the "Click to Like" button to increment the Like counter.
  c. Press the red trash icon to delete an image (with a delete confirmation pop-up).

#3. The images, text, and likes will persist through page refreshes and server restarts.
